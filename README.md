#Can we have a AI solution for resolving below presented steps?
User can have a conversation with AI that has KB about Windows Installation and other knowledge.
a. AI should walk user through the Windows installation process step-by-step: AI should ask the questions to identify the problem and then step by step write the solution based on KB.
b. Need to teach AI models how to fetch data during other responses rather than asking for it again, and rewriting if there are updates to already existing information. Also if the person has already answered the question, then the AI can skip that question and continue with the next one in list.
c. User can interrupt the AI: if the AI is writing (asking or answering), but the user asks a question in the process, the AI should interrupt its message and understand the newly asked question based on the KB.
d. It is necessary to pause and resume the scenario to run it until the end, if there is no request to stop or cancel the conversation.
